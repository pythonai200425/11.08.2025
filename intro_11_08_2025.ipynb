    "   Thus, in order to allow `jupyterlab-lsp` to navigate to external files such as packages\n",

    "   ```\n",
    "   jupyter lab --ContentsManager.allow_hidden=True\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Configuring the servers\n",
    "\n",
    "Server configurations can be edited using the Advanced Settings editor in JupyterLab (_Settings > Advanced Settings Editor_). For settings specific to each server, please see the [table of language servers][language-servers]. Example settings might include:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"language_servers\": {\n",
    "    \"pylsp\": {\n",
    "      \"serverSettings\": {\n",

    "    }\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `serverSettings` key specifies the configurations sent to the language servers. These can be written using stringified dot accessors like above (in the VSCode style), or as nested JSON objects, e.g.:\n",

    "#### Other configuration methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Some language servers, such as `pylsp`, provide other configuration methods _in addition_ to language-server configuration messages (accessed using the Advanced Settings Editor). For example, `pylsp` allows users to configure the server using a local configuration file. You can change the inspection/diagnostics for server plugins like `pycodestyle` there.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exact configuration details will vary between operating systems (please see the [configuration section of pycodestyle documentation](https://pycodestyle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#configuration)), but as an example, on Linux you would simply need to create a file called `~/.config/pycodestyle`, which may look like that:\n",

    "```cfg\n",
    "[pycodestyle]\n",
    "ignore = E402, E703\n",
    "max-line-length = 120\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ignoring E402 allows imports which are not on the very top of the file,\n",
    "- ignoring E703 allows terminating semicolon (useful for matplotlib plots),\n",
    "- the maximal allowed line length is increased to 120.\n",
    "\n",
    "After changing the configuration you may need to restart the JupyterLab, and please be advised that the errors in configuration may prevent the servers from functioning properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, please do check the pycodestyle documentation for specific error codes, and check the configuration of other feature providers and language servers as needed.\n",
